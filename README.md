# Enrollment Management System

## Introduction

This project is a **School Enrollment Management System**, developed as my thesis project and a key requirement for completing my 4th year in college‚Äîserving as a gateway toward graduation.

The system is specifically designed to support and streamline the enrollment operations of **Dipolog City Institute of Technology Inc.**, focusing on automating tasks and processes related to student enrollment. It aims to enhance efficiency, minimize manual intervention, and provide a seamless user experience for both administrators and students within the institution.

## Database

The system uses MongoDB as its database. MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database program, which provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

## Getting Started

1. **Copy the `.env` file**  
    First, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` template file in the root directory. Update the environment variables as needed, especially the database connection string.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Set up MongoDB  
   Ensure to have a MongoDB database or [download it here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

3. Seed initial data
   Before seeding, navigate to src/seeders/admin and update the database name on line 45 if necessary.

   Once your database is configured, seed the initial data by running:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   # or
   yarn seed
   # or
   pnpm seed
   # or
   bun seed
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
      npm i
      # or
      yarn install
      # or
      pnpm install
      # or
      bun install
   ```

5. Run the development server

   ```bash
      npm run dev
      # or
      yarn dev
      # or
      pnpm dev
      # or
      bun dev
   ```
